# TumbleMan
The journey of a man with simple tastes.

This is my submission to this weeks coding challange by seraj as seen [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqsfkGbBU6k) 
I set out to make a bipedal walker. I unfortunately ran out of time so "walker" might be a bit generous.

    Tumble man.
    Is a man of simple tastes.
    Like most he likes moving foreward, existing, and not falling over. (by about 1f * xvelocity to be exact)
    But unlike those more fortunate, tumble man falls. Alot.
    Maybe it's his stubby feet? Or maybe human limbs don't work by applying torque to them?
    Whatever it may be and though giving it his very best, tumble man will never walk.
    And though he can't give you state of the art performance in bipidal locomotion.
    He still wishes to share his experiance with you.

    Tumble man.
    He was born from an ideal, a thought that inspired.
    Made with a purpose, though inpure and molded by time. Expectation?
    Shaped by his own short commings, he stood up.

    But this was not enough.
    There were places he was meant to be, foreward mostly.
    And so... He moved.

    And promptly took off. By canceling out his own gravity. 
    Using the torque created in his limbs he learned to fly.
    He had done it! He had gone further than anyone had ever come!
    But it was not to last, a curse. Perhapse by divine judgement. 
    Mid fall a curse of joint based movement claimed him.
    
    To fall so far. To lose yourself over and over, perhapse a moment of hesitation.
    And just like that, he'd start again.

    Standing once more. The time had come.
    This was his one chance, fail and he'd be left in history.
    Forgotten forever.

    Was it good enough, he wondered.

## installation

If you wish to run this program yourself or look at the code simply move the folder into a new unity machine learning setup (as seen here https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Getting-Started-with-Balance-Ball.md)
